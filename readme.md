Welcome to our Timepiece Visualization. This innovative timepiece design combines creativity and functionality, offering you a distinctive way to read the hours, minutes, and seconds.

## How it Works
- **Big Circles:** Represent the hour.

- **Medium Circles:** Indicate the minutes (scaled down by 5 units)
- **Small Circles:** Show the seconds.
- **Day and Night Indicator:** The background of our timepiece adapts to your surroundings. If the background is dark, it's indicating PM; if it's light, it's indicating AM.
- **User interactions:** To tailor your experience, you can focus on specific time elements:
    - **Hour Circles Only:** Dim the minute and seconds circles by clicking on the hour circle.
    - **Minute Circles Only:** Dim the hour and seconds circles by clicking on the minute circle.
    - **Second Circles Only:** Dim the hour and minute circles by clicking on the second circle.
    - **All Circles:** Click anywhere in the background

Embrace this creative time display and experience a refreshing way to keep track of the moments. Watch the circles align to unveil the current time, and let the background guide you through the day.

Explore time in a whole new light â€“ quite literally!
